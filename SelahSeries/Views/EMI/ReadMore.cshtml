                        Many teen girls, through youthful exuberance or circumstances beyond their controls landed in the motherhood, much unprepared. Most parents, being disappointed and deeply hurt by their teenagers’' acts take some stances that are detrimental to the future of these teens and their unborn children. The society shame and shun them. They cannot move freely talk less of going back to school or attend antenatal appointments because of the toxic attitudes of the society to them. They become stranded, depressed and vulnerable. With nowhere to turn, some commit suicide while some are thrown to the boys who impregnated them or to his family. There, they suddenly become wives and mothers. Most of these girls die from domestic violence, during childbirth or suffer serious complications and losses. With the support of their families and friends gone into the thin air, they are left to face the cruelty of life, some with their children!
                        Some of these girls do not make it back to school or continue the apprenticeship they once enrolled in. Life becomes difficult for them and their babies.

                        Although, many studies have shown that many factors contribute to the increasing number of teen pregnancy in our society, we only want to dump our anger on these culprits who have disappointed us, leaving other contributory stones unturned. Meanwhile many teen girls are committing abortion to escape our wrath, whereby, many have lost their lives during this process.
                        Most times, we forget that it takes two to tangle. We spare the boys who impregnated them since they do not carry pregnancy. Aren't we a bias society?
