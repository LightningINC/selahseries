                            It occurred to me in April 2012 that I was refusing the Holy Spirit’s leading and I saw
                            revelations that confirmed this. So, later in April, I called Titi to consider my proposal. In July
                            2012, during one of the Chapel of Grace Workers’ Retreat sessions, I was led by the Holy Spirit
                            to interact with Dr. Akintunde Feyintola (a consultant gynecologist and the Chapel’s prayer
                            band leader at the time) about my relationship issues. But I was not going to do so. After the
                   ");
            WriteLiteral(@"         service, Dr. Feyintola approached me and told me Holy Spirit had led him to discuss a few
                            things with me about the youths of the Church and something related to pre-marital
                            relationships. Not all the approaches of the Holy Spirit can be this direct and instantaneous. I
                            discussed with him and we fixed prayer sessions. Prior to the scheduled appointments with Dr.
                            Feyintola, I prayed with an unprecedented intent. I surrendered my bruised ego and resolves to
                            God in the process, and I ultimately had an encounter with my Maker as I sought the way
                            forward regarding my future home. His Light illuminated my path as I got His mandate for my
                            future home; a return to Titilayo.
