                                I qualified as a Registered Nurse (RN) from the School of Nursing, Wesley Guild Hospital
                                Ilesha in 2006; completed my Bachelor’s degree in Nursing in 2014 from the historical

                                salvation story looked like the “seed lost amidst the thorns”. Every opportunity to grow met
                                with the choking and frustrating effects of legalistic doctrine, negative peer social pressure,
                                abject poverty and a setting that was not used to a teenager being “born again”. Through it all,
                                God jealously preserved me. By divine privilege, I have served as children Church teacher, an

                                I was 12, and Holy Spirit has been a reliable companion since then. As God has enabled, I have
                                written few books – THE TIME of LIFE, FULFILLING YOUR PREDESTINED

                            Only”. He proposed to me at a stage of my life when I needed answers and direction from God
                            concerning my marital life, so I told him not to bother himself about me because I was not
                            ready for such commitment and he understandably went his way but God’s mercies brought us

                            the time, I had the honour of coordinating the Royal family (a section of our Youth fellowship
                            that caters for the postgraduate students, applicants, employed and older youths). The structure
                            meant that I was expected to have a direct contact and communication with youths newly
                            arriving in the Chapel either at the Youth fellowship or the Royal family levels. So, I met her
                            after a Sunday service and we exchanged phone numbers, like we would relate with every new
                            youth in the Chapel.

                            Part of my 2010 resolution was that I was not going to consider any of the ladies around me in
                            the Chapel for a pre – marital relationship. I saw that as part of my personal leadership ethic.
                            Then, I was interested in seeking a new “catch” from outside the beauties that surrounded my
                            work and church life.

                            Incidentally, I had little passion initially to interact with Titi, but as the weeks rolled by; I
                            became interested in getting to know her better. We visited her as expected of the Youth
                            fellowship team and my initial error of thought about her being a fresh undergraduate student
                            was binned. Could this be the “Pearly Catch”? But my efforts to initiate a friendship with her
                            were unsuccessful as she sternly resisted any contact with the male folks; she was not ready for
                            the likely eventualities. Fast forward a few months, I proposed to Titi and the chain of
                            avoidance game tagged ‘just go’ began in earnest. She was neither going to give room for
                            friendship, not to think of considering a marriage proposal; nor was she going to commit her
                            word for me to wait for whatever her response was going to be, even though I was happy to
                            wait for as long as reasonable.

                            Did I get a statement from God confirming her as my wife prior to my proposing? No, not
                            exactly. However, I was sure I was on the right path, I had a good peace within me that was
                            not there whenever I sailed the wrong way. This was the explanation I gave when she asked
                            me about my convictions. So the more she resisted my proposal, the more I hung around. We
                            spent times together though, as I visited her apartment often and although she appeared to enjoy
                            it, but most conversations were too one sided, too often. It can be so frustrating when you are
                            talking for hours and not hearing anything from the other person.

                            I knew through a few revelations that she was going through some tough times which I later
                            realized; that she was walking out of a courtship of almost 3 years. Committing to another
                            suitor was not the best decision for her circumstances at the time; she had loads of things to
                            sort out with God regarding her marital life. For so long, I didn’t know this and she kept telling
                            me off, in spite of many attempts to have her commit herself that she was going to consider my
                            proposal. This experience taught me the great value of “No, sorry” or “politely buying time”.
                            Hence, I moved on after more than six months.

                            Surprisingly, Titi called me on a January evening in 2012 to ask if I wanted her to still consider
                            my earlier proposal but my answer was not tough to conclude on; No, thanks. This was simply
                            because I had committed myself in the form of a proposal to another lady and wouldn’t play
                            games on my words. Later in March 2012, I heard audibly during my morning devotion, a
                            female voice praying that God would return ‘Lekan Agunbiade to her.

                            It occurred to me in April 2012 that I was refusing the Holy Spirit’s leading and I saw
                            revelations that confirmed this. So, later in April, I called Titi to consider my proposal. In July
                            2012, during one of the Chapel of Grace Workers’ Retreat sessions, I was led by the Holy Spirit
                            to interact with Dr. Akintunde Feyintola (a consultant gynecologist and the Chapel’s prayer
                            band leader at the time) about my relationship issues. But I was not going to do so. After the
                            service, Dr. Feyintola approached me and told me Holy Spirit had led him to discuss a few
                            things with me about the youths of the Church and something related to pre-marital
                            relationships. Not all the approaches of the Holy Spirit can be this direct and instantaneous. I
                            discussed with him and we fixed prayer sessions. Prior to the scheduled appointments with Dr.
                            Feyintola, I prayed with an unprecedented intent. I surrendered my bruised ego and resolves to
                            God in the process, and I ultimately had an encounter with my Maker as I sought the way
                            forward regarding my future home. His Light illuminated my path as I got His mandate for my
                            future home; a return to Titilayo.

                            As Pearl eventually narrated to me, God had given her the nod to answer YES late in the
                            summer of year 2011 and the several proposals that came her way during her NYSC and
                            “Mama” days were not to be considered. She, in the place of prayer got to know the details and
                            the phases that I was going through, and she chose to wait, as God had instructed her. She chose
                            to obey God regardless of my prior resolve; to be humble and especially to reach out to me at
                            those crucial intervals.

                            ;We got married on 11th of May, 2013. It has been a beautiful experience. Oh yeah, we have
                            had many issues; sanguine – choleric profile married to a total phlegmatic profile means a lot
                            if you can imagine the combo; we are young; we have been nomads too many times..... But in
                            all of these things; God has remained our faithful Guide, our present help in the days of need.
